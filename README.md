# JavaScript Runtime & Concurrency Visualizer

An interactive web-based tool designed to visually demonstrate the core concepts of the JavaScript runtime environment.
This project helps in understanding how JavaScript, despite being single-threaded, handles asynchronous operations
efficiently using the Event Loop model.

This tool is perfect for presentations, knowledge-sharing sessions, or personal study to deepen your understanding of "
under-the-hood" JS concepts.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Interactive Visualization:** Watch the flow of functions and callbacks between different components of the JS
  runtime.
- **Dedicated Components:** Separate, color-coded boxes for the **Call Stack**, **Heap**, **Microtask Queue**, and *
  *Macrotask Queue**.
- **Web Worker Simulation:** A dedicated box for the **Worker Thread** to clearly demonstrate true parallelism vs.
  concurrency.
- **Multiple Scenarios:** Includes 6 distinct scenarios to demonstrate:
    1. `setTimeout` (Macrotasks)
    2. `Promise` (Microtasks)
    3. `async/await` (Syntactic Sugar for Promises)
    4. A complex interaction of `await` with Macrotasks and Microtasks.
    5. A priority demo to show Microtasks always execute before Macrotasks.
    6. `Web Workers` for heavy background computations.
- **Animation Control:** Pause and Reset functionality for each simulation.
- **Modern UI:** A clean, tab-based interface built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## üß† Concepts Covered

This project is designed to help you understand and teach the following concepts:

- **JavaScript Engine (V8):** The role of the engine.
- **Memory Management:**
    - The **Call Stack** and its LIFO (Last-In, First-Out) nature.
    - The **Memory Heap** for storing objects and functions.
    - The concept of Garbage Collection (not visualized but explained in the outline).
- **The Event Loop:** The core of the concurrency model.
- **Task Queues:**
    - **Macrotask Queue** (or Callback Queue).
    - **Microtask Queue** and its higher priority.
- **Asynchronous JavaScript:**
    - `setTimeout`
    - Promises (`.then`, `.catch`)
    - `async/await`
- **Web APIs:** The role of the browser in providing async capabilities.
- **Parallelism:**
    - **Web Workers** and how they run on separate threads.
